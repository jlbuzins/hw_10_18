The ocean plays a huge role in the global climate system. The first few meters of the ocean has the same heat
capacity as the entire atmosphere. Much of this heat capacity is driven by mixing that occurs underneath the
ocean's surface, a phenomena known as internal waves, or the mixing of less-dense fresh water with more-dense
salt water. Obtaining oceanic data is difficult and expensive, so researchers are often limited to numerical
simulation or lab-sized physical experiments, like the stratified inclined duct. These experiments can capture
a great deal of "irrelevant" data (where no mixing occurs), leading to high storage costs. To prioritize data,
there is a need for a model that can accurately label and predict the regime of an experiment, indicating in
real-time if turbulence is about to begin. The model, a convolutional neural net trained on a set of frames,
has a 90% accuracy. Here is a change.
